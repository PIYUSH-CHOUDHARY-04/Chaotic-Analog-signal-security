# Chaotic-Analog-signal-security
Analog signal encryption and decryption using analog chaotic signals

Circuit diagram for this mechanism explains how the analog chaotic signals can be used to encrypt and decrypt the analog signals which can be useful in Telephone based communication system or EMW communication.
The circuit here is not synchronized thus the tiniest change in initial condition of any circuit can cause communication failure.
Synchronization is must to be done which can be done in many ways.
